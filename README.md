# THE CONFESSIONAL


## INTRODUCTION

This project builds the React/Redux frontend for the Confessional: a place where anyone can create and read secrets. They can also like and comment on each secrets as well.

## OVERVIEW

This is a single-page application that uses:

* React

* Redux

* HTML

* CSS

The backend for this project can be found at: https://github.com/jeanetterosario88/confessional-backend.git and it contains:

* Rails as an API

* SQL Lite

* RESTful routes

## SUMMARY

This application implements two Ruby classes: Secret & Comment. This application is not user-based. Anyone can add a Secret of their own choosing. They can add their own or just read other's secrets. The secret list on the home page is sorted by likes. Upon clicking on a secret, the details appear, consisting of the title, content, and list of comments. From there, you have the ability to like and comment on the secret.
